	<h1 class="content-page-title who-we-are">Who are We?</h1>
	<div class="inner-simple-content-area"><img class="cms-thumb-imgsty" src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/cmspages/') ?>about-who-are-we.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Happily Unmarried was anti established in 2003 with no vision and no business plan. Actually at somepoint we did make a business plan but according to that we should have retired 5 years ago.</p>
		<p>We make fun products, we do music festivals, we work with corporates when they want to do interesting work and lately we have been doing a lot of projects involving branding, communication, interiors, marketing all rolled into one (we are trying to think of a name for someone who does all that but no luck yet).<br><br></p>

		<h1 class="content-page-title who-we-are">Keeping it simple!</h1>
		<p>This website was partially designed by people who hate to shop, so we have tried to keep things as simple as they possibly can be. We don't show videos when an illustration would do, we don't make the cursor do funny things while you wait for your order to get processed. Since you know how ridiculously well priced we already are we don't offer unrealistic discounts either.</p>

<h1 class="content-page-title brief-history">Brief History</h1>
<div class="inner-simple-content-area"><img class="cms-thumb-imgsty" src="<?php //echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/cmspages/') ?>brief-history-img.jpg" alt="">
	<p>The history of Happily Unmarried starts with the Neanderthals. Our team of archaeologists can say with a lot of surety that all the Neanderthals were happily unmarried. We even have a Tee shirt which says that. Of course since our programmers are still in the Neanderthal stage they may have forgotten to link it to the shopping page. So go to the shopping page, click on Tee shirts and voila!</p>
	<p>As time progressed, we became humans. Suddenly there was a general pressure to make life more complicated.The making life complicated thing continued for a few thousand years. Meanwhile in a civil war against making things complicated, we lost Dinosaurs, Dodos, most of the Tigers and a few other 100 thousand creatures which we can't  remember, but all of them were happily unmarried (now you get the picture).</p>
</div>
<div class="inner-simple-content-area"><img class="cms-thumb-imgsty1" src="<?php //echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/cmspages/') ?>brief-history-img1.jpg" alt="">
	<p>Then came the year 2003 and people said enough is enough. The Happily Unmarrieds re-grouped under the Happily Unmarried company and started propagating their wisdom to all.</p>
	<p>Things like:</p>
	<p>Have fun with what you do</p>
	<p>Keep life simple</p>
	<p>Mind the gap</p>
	<p>Do not wear ties to work</p>
	<p>Press Star key to continue</p>
	<p>You get the drift<br><br></p>
	<p>Wait, you get the drift is not the wisdom they were propagating. We mean you get the drift about the kind of wisdom they were propagating.</p>
	<p>So this is it. Here we are in the year 2000 something (can't write the exact date, God knows when this section will get updated again) and the happily unmarried company continues to sell fun, packed neatly in little brown boxes. We organise music festivals and have a little thing going on facebook as well.</p>
	<p class="cms-subtitle">To know more about us perhaps the text below may be of some use.</p>

	<p>For those who don't know, Okhla is the most advanced and well planned industrial estate in Delhi. For those who know well their is no point in lying to you since you know already! All those who manage to reach our office without calling atleast thrice, we salute you. All those who tried and failed to reach, we understand.</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 33px;">We believe that no organisation can function without interns. They are the building blocks of the future (and also the ones who do all the jobs which no one else wants to). We take our internship programme very seriously and some of the best work that has happened in our company has been done by Interns.</p>

	<div class="inner-simple-content-area">
		<p><strong class="cms-subtitle">We would like to offer a bit of advice to all interns who apply.<br> Read this only if you are genuinely interested in interning with us.</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1) Please do not name your portfolio, "portfolio.pdf", we get some many portfolio.pdf files every day that it is now impossible to keep a tab. Show us how creative you can be by giving your work a very wicked name.(please do not name it the 3 mistakes of my life, someone has done that already)</li>
			<li>2) If any resume begins with the following or anything similar sounding we do not read it:<br><br> I wish to contribute meaningfully<br><br> I am committed to excellence<br><br> I co-relate organisational goals with mine<br><br> I am a team player, hard working and sincere<br><br> I wish to begin my journey into the corporate world....<br><br> I believe self growth leads to organisational growth just like every river leads to an ocean<br><br> ..... If you are applying to us keep it brief and interesting and avoid the cliches.</li>
			<li>3) Your ideas and originality needs to reflect in everything you send us, a single paragraph is enough if it tells us how good you are.</li>
			<li>4) Two months is too little a time period, Come for 3 or 4 months or even more.</li>
			<li>5) we offer internships in Delhi only but it may involve an all expense paid trip to places like Bali, Goa, New York and London to chill out between projects.
				<ul>
					<li>5 a)    Sorry printing error read the above as We offer internships in Delhi only and it will involve travel in public transport to places like            Moradabad,Panipat, Kucha pati ram, sadar bazar and other places where no intern in your batch has ever been before.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>6) Please please do not come with your parents, we understand they can be concerned and would want to see the office (ha ha we mean the warehouse). If they were half unsure with our name we promise you they will never let you intern if they see the office (ware house).</li>
			<li>7) You can be brilliant but there is a distinct possibility that your style may not match ours or we may not understand "your work" or your thought process at all. please don't take offence. If we say no.</li>
			<li>8) We do not pay our interns too much money and occasionally we borrow from them.</li>
			<li>9) All interns get to travel free to Music in the Hills, our music fest.<br><br> (fine print: where they have to work very hard but also enjoy like no one else can).</li>
			<li>10) Take nothing seriously even the stuff you just read here.<br><br> We accept interns of all shapes and sizes in all departments be it design, marketing, ecommerce, events etc.<br><br><br> If you are enthusiastic and can work long hours get in touch  :  <a class="career-link" href="mailto:careers@happilyunmarried.com">careers@happilyunmarried.com</a> </li>

		We work with lots of designers on a project and royalty basis. Till now we have worked with over 35 designers from leading design schools.

		If you have a product idea in mind then just shoot us a mail without any inhibitions.If we like your idea we will get back to you.<br/><br/>
		If you are a design firm with manufacturing capabilities then it is even better as that takes the production load off our back.<br/><br/>
		The design fee is a part advance and part royalty on actual sale.<br/><br/>
